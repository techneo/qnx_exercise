/*

 *  This module will contain code for handling an interrupt.
 *
 *  To test it, simply run it.  Note that you may have to do something
 *  to cause the interrupts to be generated (e.g. press a key if
 *  handling the keyboard interrupt).
 * 
 *  On an x86_64 box a good choice for the interrupt to use would be:
 *    1 - keyboard
